# NixVim setup

I created this NixVim setup to isolate the packages that influence my Neovim setup. My main focus was getting a great experience working with volar lsp for Nuxt projects.

To set up it up:

Install Nix
Activate Flakes as exmperimental feature
Clone

Nix run -> Test the application
Nix build -> Build the application in the results folder
